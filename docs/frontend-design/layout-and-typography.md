# Layout, typography, and identity

English | [中文](layout-and-typography.zh.md)

## Layout skeleton
Channel and Thread surfaces use `display:grid; grid-template-rows: auto 1fr auto` for header, scrollable timeline, and composer at `height:100%`, with contained inner scrolling. The content column is centered at `max-width: 880px`; timeline padding is `clamp(18px, 3vw, 36px)`. At `max-width: 600px`, padding tightens and the header stacks; acceptance covers 390×844 without horizontal overflow. The host sidebar controls wide/rail widths; rail renders Team icon buttons.

Browser storage retains Team mode, Workspace, the last Channel/Thread location, and the Inbox page position (a navigation fact, not an unread fact), but never unread or Attention. Welcome is a separate centered surface. Thread is the navigation endpoint; an existing Task is a header/card overlay. Taskless Threads show a localized Thread/讨论 label and a promote action, not fake status or Claims. Closed Tasks replace the composer with an explanatory notice and reopen action; taskless Threads retain the normal reply composer.

Channel and Thread pages are symmetric. Both subscribe to workspace changes through the shared abortable `TeamChangeStream`; every opening or reconnection baseline requests a catch-up read, followed by matching streamed invalidations. Successful Channel refreshes clear load errors without clearing unrelated action errors. Channel top-level and Thread replies are idempotent by request ID. The Channel 「作为任务」 control is a default-off native pressed control, sends explicit taskless intent unless selected, and resets off after success.

It sits beside the attach control as the labeled mode chip of the language table above, keeping its word at every width — the composer narrows its control gaps below 560px instead of dropping the label.

## Typography and identity
| Element | Specification |
| --- | --- |
| Page h1 | 20px/28px, weight 600 |
| Sender | 13px/20px, weight 600, primary; time metadata follows on the same line |
| Message time | 11px/20px, tertiary; local HH:mm today, MM-DD HH:mm this year, full date across years |
| Inbox row time | 11px/18px, tertiary, `tabular-nums`; a bare `HH:mm` today, 「昨天 HH:mm」 on the previous local calendar day, the Message form for anything older, and the precise local `YYYY-MM-DD HH:mm` on the element's `title`. The Thread entry borrows this label for its follow-up time while its work is unfinished. An Inbox identity line too narrow for the count and the instant together does not draw it at all (see Inbox below) |
| Human body | 14px/22px at the default content size, pre-wrap and break-word; both body grids ride the Settings content-font axis (`--dsh-content-font-size` plus its px delta), so a raised content size grows message text with the rest of DSH |
| Agent body | Markdown on the same 14px/22px chat grid; compact heading sizes and list/pre/table margins. A body past the 600-character fold reads on the document rhythm instead — 16px block gaps, 6px list items, 24px lines, section-sized headings at h2 18px / h3 17px — while short bodies keep the dense grid |
| Task/activity | 11–12px tertiary, centered activity rows |
| Thread entry row | 12px/18px tertiary, `fit-content`; hover/focus-visible only brightens it and nudges the chevron |
| Entry state cluster | 11px/18px leading the entry row: 18px avatar circles, 8px status dot, status word, 18px unread capsule at 11px/600 |
| Empty/loading | 13px tertiary; 8px pulsing dots, disabled for reduced motion |

Message time comes from Host projection and shares the ledger operation instant. Consecutive same-sender messages form a run; an interval of at least five minutes gets a `TeamRunDivider`. A day boundary gets a centered date anchor. `team-separators.ts` is the single authority for both decisions.

Agent avatar hue is a stable hash of `memberId`; Human uses `--dsw-alias-state-business-primary`. That color and initial stay the Human's fallback: a stored profile avatar image replaces the initial in every seat the Human occupies, while the displayed name comes from the same profile projection, resolved once in `TeamConversation` as `name ?? t('human')` and passed down as `humanName` to both pages — so the message sender, roster rows, mention fallback names, and `member:human` refs cannot drift apart, or fall back to a literal `human` on their own.

Presence maps available/working/error/unavailable to the shared state-dot language, and two presentations carry it: the `TeamMemberAvatar` badge (the avatar's initial plus the dot on its bottom-right edge) wherever a person is listed as a row, and the bare `TeamPresenceDot` inside the composer's recipient menu, which is a menu row rather than a roster row. Roster rows therefore lean on the avatar badge while the menu stays with the dot; that asymmetry is deliberate, not an oversight.

The `TeamAvatarStack` circles on a Thread entry reuse the same hue hash but carry no dot, because they answer who owns the work rather than who is online right now.

No Agent seat ever draws an image — the hue and initial are the whole identity an Agent has — so the compact stack draws the Human's picture in the one chip that is the Human, and names that chip from the same profile projection.

The Inbox row's leading cluster and the Channel feed's Thread entry rows each take the Human's Member id from the Host (`AgentTeamInbox.humanMemberId`, the same initialization record `AgentTeamView` carries) and let `namedAvatarOwners(owners, human)` replace that one owner with `humanName`/`humanAvatarUrl`, so a rename moves the chip's letter and the stack's label together instead of leaving an initial the profile no longer uses.

Owners that are not the Human keep the shared initials, and bytes that do not decode fall back to the display name's initial through the same `useAvatarImage` the other seats use.

The Host names the Human on an Inbox row by that runtime display name as well, rather than falling back to the durable `member:human` id the Agent roster never holds.

Errors use `--dsw-alias-state-error-primary` and `role="alert"`.
