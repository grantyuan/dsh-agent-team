# Generated files, seams, and operations

English | [中文](generated-and-seams.zh.md)

## UI changes and browser evidence
Visible UI, Client bundle, slot, Remote activation, or interaction changes must run `npm run test:browser`. Screenshots go to ignored `artifacts/browser/` and do not overwrite archived evidence. Review at least:

```text
1440×960: hierarchy, empty/loading/error states, density, and ordinary DSH restoration
390×844 : no horizontal overflow, visible key content, modal/menu inside the viewport
Keyboard: visible focus, Tab/Enter/Space/Escape behavior, accessible dialog/menu names
State: failed submits preserve input; durable mutations render Host projections
```

Browser-local presentation preferences — for example the Team sidebar's Channel/Agent row order in `dsh.agent-team.sidebar-order` — are UI-preference persistence, not Team facts: when their shape changes, verify drag and post-refresh reconcile against the review list above.

These screenshots are human review material, not pixel snapshots. Keep only a small set of milestone images under `.scratch/archive/YYYY-MM/<work>/validation/`, with filenames, acceptance points, and rerun commands. Keep debug screenshots, recordings, logs, and complete test-run image sets ignored.

## Generated files
Do not edit these directly:

- `packages/agent-team/lib/typert.host.*`
- `packages/agent-team/lib/typert.remote-client.*`
- `tsconfig.json`
- `tsconfig.types.json`
- `tsconfig.build-deps.json`

Remote artifacts come from `scripts/generate-typert.mjs`; TypeScript path facades come from `scripts/sync-paths.mjs`:

```sh
npm run generate:typert
node scripts/sync-paths.mjs
```

The `tsconfig*.json` facades must not gain `include` or `files`; they must continue matching repository files and adjacent Harness source/declarations.

`generate:typert` analyses a copy of the Host face inside the Harness checkout, so it provisions that temp package's external dependencies itself: the context-continuity engine's built declarations are copied in, and `zod` is linked from this repository's root install — a symlink on POSIX, a directory junction on Windows, where a real symlink is privilege-gated.

Keep `zod` a link: a copy puts zod's own declarations inside the analysed package, where the analyzer's reachable-files walk queues a declaration file the program never loaded and dies with a `TypeError` rather than a diagnostic; a link that does not resolve instead surfaces as `TS2307: Cannot find module 'zod'` in every importing file.

## Package seams and module layout
The published artifact is one root npm package, `@wowyuarm/dsh-agent-team`, declared by the root `package.json` and its `exports` map. The three `packages/*` directories have no manifest of their own: they are the build and export seams of that single package, each with its own build target and its own entry in `exports`.

```text
@wowyuarm/dsh-agent-team               root manifest, one published package
├── packages/agent-team         → ./host, ./types, ./typert, ./remote, …
├── packages/tool-agent-team    → ./tools
└── packages/client-agent-team  → . (the plugin entry) and ./client
```

Consumers therefore reach a package through a declared subpath (`@wowyuarm/dsh-agent-team/host`, `/remote`, `/types`, `/tools`, `/client`), never through a relative path into another directory's `lib/`. The generated `tsconfig*.json` facades and the Client bundler both map those subpaths, so a source-level relative import across seams bypasses the very contract that keeps generated artifacts swappable. `scripts/harness-dir.mjs` is the single pointer those mappings resolve the adjacent Harness checkout through.

Host source is deliberately flat. `packages/agent-team/src/` separates authority from seams by file, with three structural anchors — `index.ts` is the composition root and Remote adapter, `ledger.ts` is the durable authority, and `spec.ts` plus the `types.ts` barrel own the record schema and the public types. Every other file is one earned seam; [`architecture/README.md`](../architecture/README.md) names them and what each owns.

Two consequences follow, and both are cheaper to obey than to repair: what earns a seam, and why a thin rename is deleted rather than kept. Both are stated with the ownership rules in [`architecture/package-ownership.md`](../architecture/package-ownership.md).

## Adding a Host operation
A durable Team operation is one vertical slice through the authority layer, not a per-layer task list. Add the type, the record, the commit, the projection, and the read surface in the same change; the ledger rejects a record it cannot replay, so a partial slice fails loudly rather than silently.

```text
types/operations.ts   the operation record type
spec.ts               the record schema for that kind
ledger.ts             commit method + per-kind change scope + validation + projection application
index.ts              the @Remote(...) action that authorizes and dispatches
types/requests-results.ts   the public request and result shapes
```

The six mechanical surfaces that must change together:

1. **Kind and record.** Add the operation kind as a `z.literal` in its record schema in `spec.ts`, and its typed record in `types/operations.ts`.
2. **Public shapes.** Add the request and result types to `types/requests-results.ts`; `types.ts` is the public barrel and re-exports them, so it needs no per-operation edit.
3. **Commit.** Add the ledger method that builds the record from `operationBase(...)` plus the next sequence, and the change scope it wakes.
4. **Validation and projection.** Extend the ledger's per-kind commit validation and its validation entry point, and add the case that applies the record to a projection. Replay correctness lives here — a projection that is not applied on load diverges from the durable table.
5. **Host and Remote.** Add the `@Remote('<action>')` method in `index.ts`: authorize, dispatch to the ledger with the Human or Member actor, and emit the committed receipt.
6. **Tests and docs.** Cover commit, replay, authorization, and the projection effect; then update the owning maintained document (`architecture/README.md` for boundaries, `domain-model.md` for semantics, `team-collaboration/README.md` for a model-facing contract).

The invariant companion is checked, not extended: `invariant.ts` registers one `agentTeam` invariant that validates the whole durable ledger at mount and after commits, so a new operation is covered automatically once it replays. Extend it only when the new record shape needs a relationship the projection validator does not already assert.

Two boundaries this checklist depends on:

- Operation-kind semantics stay concentrated in `ledger.ts`. Do not split them across new modules to shorten the file, and do not factor the `spec.ts` record schemas into shared helpers — the per-kind shells are deliberate, and a kind's validation is only meaningful beside its projection.
- A new operation is not a new service. It enters through the existing ledger and the existing Remote adapter; it does not add a store, a parallel projection, or a second authority.

Verify with `npm run typecheck`, the narrowest Host test target, and `npm run test:browser` when the operation reaches the Client. `npm run check:boundaries` runs as part of `npm test` and fails if the change reaches another package by a relative path instead of a declared subpath.
