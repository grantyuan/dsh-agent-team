/**
 * Team's projection contribution to the context-continuity engine: the durable
 * ref naming, the Team-notice rule, and the domain judgement that decides which
 * events anchor a timeline boundary and what each boundary is attributable to.
 *
 * The fold itself is the engine's (`createContextProjectionDefinition`): one
 * registered unit per Host folds every Session's durable log and owns the
 * universal structure — checkpoints, the pending rollover intent, quiet
 * continuation delivery, carry candidates, open calls, turn cursors. This
 * module supplies only what the engine deliberately refuses to know:
 *
 * - the durable refs Team's existing logs already carry
 *   (`context-checkpoint-<sha256>`, `team-boundary-<sha256>`), frozen because
 *   recorded history is read back through them;
 * - which queued messages are Team-owned notices the successor rederives;
 * - which successful Team calls anchor a boundary, and which Threads each
 *   boundary is attributable to. A claim mutation resolves its Task's Thread
 *   through the ledger; that binding is written once at Task creation, so a
 *   re-fold reproduces the same attribution, and a missing ledger or mapping
 *   yields no attribution instead of failing the fold.
 *
 * The remaining exports are read views over the engine's state that Team still
 * owns: the anchor lookups the rollover guard revalidates a cited ref through,
 * the accumulated Thread attribution that guard and the timeline both judge a
 * boundary by, and carried-message resolution — the engine keys carry
 * candidates by message id, and the durable log is where the message body
 * lives.
