/**
 * Package-boundary check for the Agent Team plugin.
 *
 * The repository publishes one root package whose three `packages/*` directories
 * are build/export seams. A source file therefore reaches another seam through a
 * declared subpath (`@wowyuarm/dsh-agent-team/remote`), never by climbing out of
 * its own package directory with a relative specifier. Such an import bypasses
 * the `exports` map and the generated `tsconfig*.json` path facades, which is the
 * contract that keeps generated artifacts swappable.
 *
 * `import type` is exempt: it is erased before runtime, so it cannot leak a
 * generated file into the bundle or create runtime coupling.
 *
 * Deliberate scope limits, so the rule does not overreach:
 * - Only source is scanned. Test files explicitly wire directories together and
 *   may reach the repository's shared `scripts/` helpers.
 * - Only *escaping* relative specifiers are rejected. A path that stays inside
 *   the file's own package directory (`./x.ts`, `../y.ts`) is always fine.
 * - Declared subpaths other than the package's own are not cross-checked against
 *   the `exports` map; that would need a resolution engine and is not the defect
 *   this check exists to prevent.
 *
 * The import-kind logic is deliberately statement-based rather than a single
 * regular expression: a `[^;]*` style class spans newlines in a multiline file
 * and silently swallows the rest of the import block, which makes the check pass
 * while enforcing nothing.
